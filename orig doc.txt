"INTRODUCTION",

"This Site-specific Health & Safety Plan (SSHSP) has been prepared for Shannon & Wilson personnel performing project-specific activities for the " +
form.jobName.value + " in " + form.fieldLocation.value +
".  This plan provides a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) specific to the site and the work to be performed during the project.  All field personnel must understand the JSA before going to the site.  Acknowledgement that personnel are aware of this SSHSP and the JSA will be documented by signing the Acknowledgement Form included on the back of this document.  " +

"Field activities to be performed under this SSHSP include the following: " +
form.fieldActivity.value +
".  If field activities other than those noted are performed, this document should be revised. The field activities are anticipated to extend from " +
form.fieldStart.value + " to " + form.fieldEnd.value + ".",

"ORGANIZATION",

"Shannon & Wilson expects its employees to follow the policies and procedures set forth in the Corporate Health and Safety plan and the specific guidelines included in this SSHSP. Employees at all level of organization are covered by this requirement. In certain cases, deviations to a policy or procedure may be appropriate, but any changes must bye justifiable and documented. Changes in this program will only be made with the prior approval of the Site Safety Officer (SSO).",

"The goal on this project, as on all Shannon & Wilson projects, is to experience zero injuries and to remain in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local health and safety requirements.  Personnel accountable for employee's safety and health on this project include the Project Manager (PM), the SSO, and the Health and Safety Officer (HSO). The names and contact numbers for these key personnel for this project are listed below.",
